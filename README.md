# About Me
Hi, I'm Berk Akkaya. I'm 17 years old student that tries to master in Python and learn diffrent programming languages.
In these times I work on projects that uses Machine Learning. Actually I'm very beginner at it but the capabilities you can do
with it are amazing and it excites me a lot.

I'm also studying on mobile development. I'm new at Java. I learned it's syntax and some basics but I think it will take
time to master in that language ðŸ˜„

After learning Java (and Kotlin - maybe) I also want to learn Flutter. It looks very interesting and exciting to me.
Also I know Node.js but I'm a beginner of it.

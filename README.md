# About Me
Hi, I'm Berk Akkaya. I'm 17 years old student that tries to master in Python and learn diffrent programming languages.
In these times I work on projects that uses Machine Learning. Actually I'm very beginner at it but the things you can do
with it are amazing and it excites me a lot.

I'm also studying on mobile development. I'm new at Java. I learned it's syntax and some basics but I think it will take
time to master in that language ðŸ˜„

After learning Java (and Kotlin - maybe) I also want to learn Flutter. It looks very interesting and exciting to me.
Also I know Node.js but I'm a beginner of it.

I added my Twitter account and email to my profile. You can contact me from my email.

And also I am managing a programming team of my school. My team has 5 member excluding our teacher.
Our team is still new and it has only one project at this time but in future we will build new projects.

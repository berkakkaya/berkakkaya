# 👋 Hi, I’m Berk

I’m a **Software Engineer** primarily focused on **mobile app development**, with a strong interest in building clean, privacy respectful and user friendly software. I enjoy working across the stack when needed, but my main expertise lies in **Flutter** and cross platform application development.

I care a lot about **open source**, **Linux based systems**, and **self hostable** technologies. I believe software should be simple, transparent to its users, and respectful of their data.

# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Hi! I'm Berk Akkaya. I'm a developer mainly focused on mobile app development.

## ðŸŽ¯ My Goals and Principles

My goal are to make apps that will make lives of other people easier. I'm really
a big fan of Linux, open-source, self-hostable and privacy focused software.
So I try to use these concepts in my own projects too.

I think that apps should be simple, clean, easy to use. Things should not
get in users' way. App should be opeque to its users, it shouldn't be
privacy invasive. Also I think that software should be open-source when it's
possible.

I'm really a big fan of Linux, open-source and self-hostable softwares.
I try to apply these concepts in my projects as much as I can.

## ðŸ“š What I Know (Right Now)

As programming languages I know C, C++, Java, Python and Dart. I'm experienced
in Flutter. I can create REST APIs (with Flask) and authentication services,
utilize web socket architecture, use MongoDB and Microsoft SQL Server as a database.
I have some knowledge about Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I can train
models to classify data (also images).

## ðŸ‘€ What I Plan to Learn

- I can create apps with Flutter, but I want to extend my knowledge to native Android development. I plan to learn Kotlin and get experienced in native Android side too (also iOS development side - if I can get a MacBook in my hands in the future ðŸ˜„).
- I know Docker (and I love its concept), but I really want to know it with its full extend. I'll learn to create images with Docker and manage containers and such effectively.
- After that, I think of getting experienced in Web Developement. I can strengthen my knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After that, I can learn React too, but it's not my plan right now.

## â›³ My Hobbies

I like listening to music - all the time. I listen to music when I travel, when I study,
pretty much at everyting. I also like watching movies, though I can't find much time
to watch them.

I love Linux based distros, so much. I have years (and years) of experience
in *distro hopping* ðŸ˜„. I tried to many Linux distros and I follow open-source
and Linux content creators to see what's new. I also gained precious experience
from it, it teached me how to manage Linux system and different concepts in
Linux world that I've never heard of in Windows land.

## About Me
Hi, I'm Berk Akkaya. I'm 19 years old student that tries to master in Python and learn different programming languages.
Also I study on Machine Learning and am currently working on project that uses Machine Learning.
Actually I'm very beginner at it but the things you can do with it are amazing and it excites me a lot.

I'm also studying on mobile development. For now I know Flutter and currently I'm building the frontend of project
that I mentioned before. I also doing side projects in Flutter but I don't have much time to work on these. Beside
from Flutter I can also use Java for Android development but I'm actually beginner of it and can't write beautiful
applications as I can do with Flutter. In the future I'm planning to learn React Native after I feel comfortable
with web development and React.

In the backend (*dark side* ðŸ˜„) I can write Flask applications and use Node.js. I generally use Node.js because
I feel more comfortable with JavaScript. Also I want to learn TypeScript because I think it's much safer to
work with static types.

And also I am managing a programming team of my school. My team has 5 member excluding our teacher.
Our team is still new and it has only one project at this time but in future we will build new projects.

## Contact
I added my Twitter account and email to my profile. I live in Turkey (which is GMT+03:00) and I have lots of
work to do (because of exams) so I may not be able to answer quickly.

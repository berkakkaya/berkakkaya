# About Me
Hi, I'm Berk Akkaya. I'm 17 years old student that tries to master in Python and learn diffrent programming languages.
In these times I work on projects that uses Machine Learning. Actually I'm very beginner at it but the capabilities you can do
with it are amazing and it excites me a lot.

I'm also studying on mobile development. I'm new at Java. I learned it's syntax and some basics but I think it will take
time to master in that language ðŸ˜„

After learning Java (and Kotlin - maybe) I also want to learn Flutter. It looks very interesting and exciting to me.
Also I know Node.js but I'm a beginner of it.

Besides from these also I know Node.js but I'm a beginner of it.

(Tweets in Turkish, I don't write tweets in English for now, sorry)

And also I am managing a programming team of my school. My team has 5 member excluding our teacher.
Our team is still new and it has only one project at this time but in future we will build new projects.

Also I added my email to my profile, you can contact me here.

## Beginning of My Programming Adventure
Being a software developer was my dream job in my childhood, also I was trying to learn a programming language but at these times
I couldn't do it. There weren't enough source about programming for beginners and my knowledge about English was not good.
And I couldn't feel that I am ready to learn a programming language.

In summer of 2017, me and my friends were talking in Discord and one of our conversations we talked about bots in Discord.
They were very exciting and I decided to make one of myself as a hobby. After a little research I decided to learn Node.js.
Firstly I learned little JavaScript. Then I learned some Node.js and Discord.js (a framework that you can develop bots for Discord).
After then I wrote my very first script. My bot was just replying what we want bot to reply. But it was very funny. We enjoyed
very much with it and I added new commands to it. After these times I studied to high school exams and in that time I didn't have
any free time to work with my bot.

After these exams I attended to high school and I added some command to my bot, but I haven't put much effort on my bot in my first
year in high school. And second year in high school I met with Python. I loved it very much. Then in lesson breaks I started to
go to our computer lab and work on Python. My first project on Python was the Hangman Game. I very enjoyed working on it.
One day my teacher called me to the computer lab and wanted me to make a GUI application on Python. It was very basic GUI that
has one line edit and a push button. It was just printing what we type on line edit. After developing the app with my teacher's
suggestions, teacher called me again to computer lab and wanted me to write a chat application. I was not sure that I can do it
but I tried and succeed! I was very happy that I succeed.

There are a lot of story after that, but I don't want to extend that too much. And if you want to check out that project,
